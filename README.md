# what-is-this
Historically, the term "Common English" has been associated with the meaning of "language of the commoners" or "language of the common people." It referred to the everyday language spoken by ordinary people rather than the language used by the aristocracy or the educated elite. However, language and its meanings can evolve over time, and in contemporary usage, "Common English" does not carry the same connotation.</br></br>
"Common English" in the context of language now refers to English that is commonly understood and shared by both humans and machines. It signifies a linguistic framework that allows seamless communication and interaction between human users and various automated systems or artificial intelligence technologies. This concept involves developing a standardized form of English that can be easily interpreted and processed by machines, facilitating efficient information exchange and comprehension. By establishing a shared language, Common English aims to bridge the gap between human communication and the capabilities of intelligent machines, fostering improved collaboration and interaction in various domains such as natural language processing, virtual assistants, and automated systems.
